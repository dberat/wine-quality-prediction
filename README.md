# Quality Assessment of Red Wine Using Machine Learning
---

This repository has the code for a comprehensive analysis of red wine quality using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Decision Tree technique. Through this project, I aim to predict and understand the factors that contribute to the quality of red wines, providing valuable insights for wine enthusiasts and industry professionals alike.

This time I used CRISP-DM method to document my code and project instead of writing a Medium article.


## Overview
---
- `main.ipynb` notebook contains the code.
- `winequality-red.csv` contains the dataset that was used for training the machine learning model.
